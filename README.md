# Timestamp Microservice

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/timestamp-microservice.

## Functionality

This is the [timestamp microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice) project, where I make a simple express API that returns timestamps in a JSON format.

## Thoughts

The structure of the API was simple enough, but what was most challenging was just getting the formatting of the dates and times correct. Eventually I ended up using Moment to make that happen.

I initially created this in Replit, but thought it would be good to recreate it in my local IDE and push it to GitHub, so here it is.

God bless.
